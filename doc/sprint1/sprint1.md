Participants: Werner, Jaimin, Monica, Flavio

Notetaker: Flavio

As detailed in the PRM.md, for sprint 1 we have planed to work on the following user stories for the duration of sprint 1:

Guest Play
  Allows users to play a match of chess without creating an account, ensuring accessibility for casual users.

Multiple Language Support
  Provides language options for users, expanding inclusivity and accessibility for users who don’t speak the same language as the development team.

Timer Mode
  Adds a time-based challenge to gameplay, enhancing engagement and improving users’ decision-making under time constraints.

Tutorial on How to Play for Beginners
  Offers an interactive tutorial for new players, aligning with our mission to create a welcoming and educational environment for beginner chess players.

Themes & Local Customization
  Customization options for board themes, piece styles, and colors.

We also determined the amount of points via agile each user stories we selected for this sprint: 

User Story Point Estimations

  Guest Play – 3 Points: This is a small but critical feature that involves enabling guest login without account creation. It requires some backend work for user session management but isn’t overly complex.

  Multiple Language Support – 5 Points: Implementing multilingual support involves translating UI text and possibly managing language files. While it’s not particularly difficult, it does require time and 
  attention to detail, especially to ensure no UI issues arise with different language lengths.

  Timer Mode – 8 Points: Adding a timer requires front-end and back-end changes to manage timing, potential game-state updates, and user notifications. The complexity is moderate to high due to the real-time   component and UI considerations.

  Tutorial on How to Play for Beginners – 8 Points: This requires a guided, interactive experience for new users, with potential animations and instructional overlays. It’s complex and involves careful   
  planning to ensure accessibility and clarity for beginners.

  Themes & Local Customization – 8 Points: Implementing themes requires developing customizable UI components and providing options for theme selection (e.g., light and dark modes or color themes). Local 
  customization may involve adapting the interface to accommodate different regional preferences, which adds another layer of complexity.

Preliminary Task Breakdown

Each user story will be divided into tasks to manage workflow effectively. We also need to assign tasks for the other project requirements. Initial task outlines are as follows:

  Guest Play
    Design and develop guest access mode
    Set access limitations for guest users
    Testing and debugging guest functionality

  Multiple Language Support
    Identify and implement languages
    Create language selection interface
    Testing for language-specific UI consistency

  Timer Mode
    Design timer options (e.g., blitz, rapid)
    Implement timer mechanics
    Testing and adjustments based on feedback
    Tutorial on How to Play for Beginners

  Design tutorial flow and interactive elements
    Develop tutorial content with step-by-step instructions
    Testing tutorial interactions for clarity and usability
    
  Themes & Local Customization 
    Design a UI component allowing users to select their preferred theme.
    Ensure compatibility with the existing UI structure.

  Code Structure and Organization
    Describe the organization of the codebase, including folder structure and key modules.
    Write detailed documentation for core classes, modules, and functions.
    Outline any testing tools or frameworks and how to run tests locally.

  Project/Sprint Documentation
    Write a concise overview of the project, including objectives, goals, and key requirements (sprint and standups). 
    Review the entire document for clarity, consistency, and completeness.
    Edit for grammar, style, and formatting consistency.


Responsibilities 

Each of these tasks will be assigned to a group member to handle during this sprint, for the local customization / timer mode / tutorial tasks these will be assessed and determined if these can be completed during the 1st sprint. If these tasks cannot be reasonably completed before the deadline on Nov 3rd then these tasks will be moved for the 2nd sprint with the reason being added to their user story trello card. The tasks have been assigned to the following group members:
